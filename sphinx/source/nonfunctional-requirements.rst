==============================

3.1. Response Time
------------------
 Since the users might have a lot of data to process,so considering the reasons for improving the user experience,this web application should be really quickly.After the discussion, we have decided the limit of response time, it should less than 5 seconds for the most using cases.

3.2. Aesthetic Aspects
----------------------
 Because the scatter plot will display many spots, the interface should be as simple as possible and make the scatter plot more distinct. It will be helpful for users to analyze the data.

3.3. Confidentiality Policy
---------------------------
 This project is a public web application, it is important to ensure data security. Especially for some biologist, they attach great importance to experimental data. So this application must keep experimental data confidential and the data must not be allowed to read without agreement of the owner.
